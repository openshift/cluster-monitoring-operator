# This configmap is used by the cluster monitoring operator to configure the
# telemeter client which is in charge of reading the metrics from the
# in-cluster Prometheus instances and forwarding them to the Telemetry service.
#
# The only supported key in metrics.yaml is "matches" which is a list of label
# selectors that define which metrics are going to be forwarded. Label
# selectors can select a single metric (e.g. '{__name__="foo"}') or all
# metric names matching a regexp (e.g. '{__name__=~"foo:.+"}').
#
# Every entry should be commented with the owners (GitHub handles preferred)
# and a short description of the metric(s). It is also possible to mention the
# consumers (again handles preferred) so that any change to the metric can be
# communicated to the right audience.
