# OpenShift 4 Data Collection

Red Hat values our customers' experience and privacy. It is important to us that our customers understand exactly what we are sending back to Red Hat Engineering and why. We want to be able to make changes to our designs and coding practices rapidly, based on our customers' environments. The faster the feedback loop the better.

OpenShift 4 clusters send anonymized telemetry back to Red Hat about the following attributes. The telemetry is gathered by referencing your cluster ID and pull secret:

[embedmd]:# (../manifests/0000_50_cluster-monitoring-operator_04-config.yaml)
```yaml
# This configmap is used by the cluster monitoring operator to configure the
# telemeter client which is in charge of reading the metrics from the
# in-cluster Prometheus instances and forwarding them to the Telemetry service.
#
# The only supported key in metrics.yaml is "matches" which is a list of label
# selectors that define which metrics are going to be forwarded. Label
# selectors can select an single metric (e.g. '{__name__="foo"}') or all
# metric names matching a regexp (e.g. '{__name__=~"foo:.+"}').
#
# Every entry should be commented with the owners (GitHub handles preferred)
# and a short description of the metric(s). It is also possible to mention the
# consumers (again handles preferred) so that any change to the metric can be
# communicated to the right audience.

These attributes provide a snapshot of the health, usage, and size of a cluster. From this we can determine the functionality of the framework components. This information helps Red Hat to identify correlations between issues experienced across many OpenShift 4 clusters that have similar environmental characteristics. This enables Red Hat to rapidly develop changes in OpenShift 4 to improve software resilience and customer experience.

In some situations it might be necessary to opt out of remote health reporting. For more information on this topic, please see [Opting out of remote health reporting](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/support/remote_health_monitoring/opting-out-of-remote-health-reporting.html) in the OpenShift Container Platform 4 documentation.
