| Property | Type | Description 
|collectors|link:nodeexportercollectorconfig.adoc[NodeExporterCollectorConfig]|Defines which collectors are enabled and their additional configuration parameters.

|maxProcs|uint32|The target number of CPUs on which the Node Exporter's process will run. The default value here is `0`, which means that Node Exporter runs on all CPUs. If a kernel deadlock occurs or if performance degrades when reading from `sysfs` concurrently, you can change this value to `1`, which limits Node Exporter to running on one CPU. For nodes with a high CPU count, you can set the limit to a low number, which  saves resources by preventing Go routines from being scheduled to run on all CPUs. However, I/O performance degrades if the `maxProcs` value is set too low, and there are many metrics to collect.
