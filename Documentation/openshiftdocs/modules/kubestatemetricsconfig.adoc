| Property | Type | Description 
|nodeSelector|map[string]string|Defines the nodes on which the pods are scheduled.

|resources|*v1.ResourceRequirements|Defines resource requests and limits for the KubeStateMetrics container.

|tolerations|[]v1.Toleration|Defines tolerations for the pods.

|topologySpreadConstraints|[]v1.TopologySpreadConstraint|Defines a pod's topology spread constraints.

|additionalLabelsAllowList|*string|Defines label-metrics' allow list for resources in addition to the default one. Currently, this is only supported for `jobs` and `cronjobs`, due to cardinality concerns. This follows the format: resource1=[label1,label2,labelN...],...,resourceN=[...], which is then validated and appended to the default labels' allow list.
