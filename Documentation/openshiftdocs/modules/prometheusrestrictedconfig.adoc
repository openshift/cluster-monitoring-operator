| Property | Type | Description 
|scrapeInterval|string|Configures the default interval between consecutive scrapes in case the `ServiceMonitor` or `PodMonitor` resource does not specify any value. The interval must be set between 5 seconds and 5 minutes. The value can be expressed in: seconds (for example `30s`.), minutes (for example `1m`.) or a mix of minutes and seconds (for example `1m30s`.). The default value is `30s`.

|evaluationInterval|string|Configures the default interval between rule evaluations in case the `PrometheusRule` resource does not specify any value. The interval must be set between 5 seconds and 5 minutes. The value can be expressed in: seconds (for example `30s`.), minutes (for example `1m`.) or a mix of minutes and seconds (for example `1m30s`.). It only applies to `PrometheusRule` resources with the `openshift.io/prometheus-rule-evaluation-scope=\"leaf-prometheus\"` label. The default value is `30s`.

|additionalAlertmanagerConfigs|[]link:additionalalertmanagerconfig.adoc[AdditionalAlertmanagerConfig]|Configures additional Alertmanager instances that receive alerts from the Prometheus component. By default, no additional Alertmanager instances are configured.

|enforcedLabelLimit|*uint64|Specifies a per-scrape limit on the number of labels accepted for a sample. If the number of labels exceeds this limit after metric relabeling, the entire scrape is treated as failed. The default value is `0`, which means that no limit is set.

|enforcedLabelNameLengthLimit|*uint64|Specifies a per-scrape limit on the length of a label name for a sample. If the length of a label name exceeds this limit after metric relabeling, the entire scrape is treated as failed. The default value is `0`, which means that no limit is set.

|enforcedLabelValueLengthLimit|*uint64|Specifies a per-scrape limit on the length of a label value for a sample. If the length of a label value exceeds this limit after metric relabeling, the entire scrape is treated as failed. The default value is `0`, which means that no limit is set.

|enforcedSampleLimit|*uint64|Specifies a global limit on the number of scraped samples that will be accepted. This setting overrides the `SampleLimit` value set in any user-defined `ServiceMonitor` or `PodMonitor` object if the value is greater than `enforcedTargetLimit`. Administrators can use this setting to keep the overall number of samples under control. The default value is `0`, which means that no limit is set.

|enforcedTargetLimit|*uint64|Specifies a global limit on the number of scraped targets. This setting overrides the `TargetLimit` value set in any user-defined `ServiceMonitor` or `PodMonitor` object if the value is greater than `enforcedSampleLimit`. Administrators can use this setting to keep the overall number of targets under control. The default value is `0`.

|externalLabels|ExternalLabels|Defines labels to be added to any time series or alerts when communicating with external systems such as federation, remote storage, and Alertmanager. The type is map[string]string. By default, no labels are added.

|logLevel|string|Defines the log level setting for Prometheus. The possible values are `error`, `warn`, `info`, and `debug`. The default setting is `info`.

|nodeSelector|map[string]string|Defines the nodes on which the pods are scheduled.

|queryLogFile|string|Specifies the file to which PromQL queries are logged. This setting can be either a filename, in which case the queries are saved to an `emptyDir` volume at `/var/log/prometheus`, or a full path to a location where an `emptyDir` volume will be mounted and the queries saved. Writing to `/dev/stderr`, `/dev/stdout` or `/dev/null` is supported, but writing to any other `/dev/` path is not supported. Relative paths are also not supported. By default, PromQL queries are not logged.

|remoteWrite|[]link:remotewritespec.adoc[RemoteWriteSpec]|Defines the remote write configuration, including URL, authentication, and relabeling settings.

|resources|*v1.ResourceRequirements|Defines resource requests and limits for the Prometheus container.

|retention|string|Defines the duration for which Prometheus retains data. This definition must be specified using the following regular expression pattern: `[0-9]+(ms\|s\|m\|h\|d\|w\|y)` (ms = milliseconds, s= seconds,m = minutes, h = hours, d = days, w = weeks, y = years). The default value is `24h`.

|retentionSize|string|Defines the maximum amount of disk space used by data blocks plus the write-ahead log (WAL). Supported values are `B`, `KB`, `KiB`, `MB`, `MiB`, `GB`, `GiB`, `TB`, `TiB`, `PB`, `PiB`, `EB`, and `EiB`. The default value is `nil`.

|tolerations|[]v1.Toleration|Defines tolerations for the pods.

|topologySpreadConstraints|[]v1.TopologySpreadConstraint|Defines a pod's topology spread constraints.

|volumeClaimTemplate|*monv1.EmbeddedPersistentVolumeClaim|Defines persistent storage for Prometheus. Use this setting to configure the storage class and size of a volume.
