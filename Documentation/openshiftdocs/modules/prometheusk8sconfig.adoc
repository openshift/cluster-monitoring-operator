| Property | Type | Description 
|additionalAlertmanagerConfigs|[]link:additionalalertmanagerconfig.adoc[AdditionalAlertmanagerConfig]|Configures additional Alertmanager instances that receive alerts from the Prometheus component. By default, no additional Alertmanager instances are configured.

|enforcedBodySizeLimit|string|Enforces a body size limit for Prometheus scraped metrics. If a scraped target's body response is larger than the limit, the scrape will fail. The following values are valid: an empty value to specify no limit, a numeric value in Prometheus size format (such as `64MB`), or the string `automatic`, which indicates that the limit will be automatically calculated based on cluster capacity. The default value is empty, which indicates no limit.

|externalLabels|map[string]string|Defines labels to be added to any time series or alerts when communicating with external systems such as federation, remote storage, and Alertmanager. By default, no labels are added.

|logLevel|string|Defines the log level setting for Prometheus. The possible values are: `error`, `warn`, `info`, and `debug`. The default value is `info`.

|nodeSelector|map[string]string|Defines the nodes on which the pods are scheduled.

|queryLogFile|string|Specifies the file to which PromQL queries are logged. This setting can be either a filename, in which case the queries are saved to an `emptyDir` volume at `/var/log/prometheus`, or a full path to a location where an `emptyDir` volume will be mounted and the queries saved. Writing to `/dev/stderr`, `/dev/stdout` or `/dev/null` is supported, but writing to any other `/dev/` path is not supported. Relative paths are also not supported. By default, PromQL queries are not logged.

|remoteWrite|[]link:remotewritespec.adoc[RemoteWriteSpec]|Defines the remote write configuration, including URL, authentication, and relabeling settings.

|resources|*v1.ResourceRequirements|Defines resource requests and limits for the Prometheus container.

|retention|string|Defines the duration for which Prometheus retains data. This definition must be specified using the following regular expression pattern: `[0-9]+(ms\|s\|m\|h\|d\|w\|y)` (ms = milliseconds, s= seconds,m = minutes, h = hours, d = days, w = weeks, y = years). The default value is `15d`.

|retentionSize|string|Defines the maximum amount of disk space used by data blocks plus the write-ahead log (WAL). Supported values are `B`, `KB`, `KiB`, `MB`, `MiB`, `GB`, `GiB`, `TB`, `TiB`, `PB`, `PiB`, `EB`, and `EiB`. By default, no limit is defined.

|tolerations|[]v1.Toleration|Defines tolerations for the pods.

|topologySpreadConstraints|[]v1.TopologySpreadConstraint|Defines the pod's topology spread constraints.

|collectionProfile|CollectionProfile|Defines the metrics collection profile that Prometheus uses to collect metrics from the platform components. Supported values are `full` or `minimal`. In the `full` profile (default), Prometheus collects all metrics that are exposed by the platform components. In the `minimal` profile, Prometheus only collects metrics necessary for the default platform alerts, recording rules, telemetry and console dashboards.

|volumeClaimTemplate|*monv1.EmbeddedPersistentVolumeClaim|Defines persistent storage for Prometheus. Use this setting to configure the persistent volume claim, including storage class, volume size and name.
