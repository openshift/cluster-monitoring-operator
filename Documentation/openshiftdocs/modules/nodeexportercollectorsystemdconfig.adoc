== NodeExporterCollectorSystemdConfig

=== Description

The `NodeExporterCollectorSystemdConfig` resource works as an on/off switch for the `systemd` collector of the `node-exporter` agent. By default, the `systemd` collector is disabled. If enabled, the following metrics become available: `node_systemd_system_running`, `node_systemd_timer_last_trigger_seconds`, `node_systemd_units`, `node_systemd_version`. If the unit uses a socket, it also generates these 3 metrics: `node_systemd_socket_accepted_connections_total`, `node_systemd_socket_current_connections`, `node_systemd_socket_refused_connections_total`. You can use the `units` parameter to select the systemd units to be included by the `systemd` collector. The selected units are used to generate the `node_systemd_unit_state` metric, which shows the state of each systemd unit. However, this metric's cardinality might be high (at least 5 series per unit per node). If you enable this collector with a long list of selected units, closely monitor the `prometheus-k8s` deployment for excessive memory usage.

| Property | Type | Description 
|enabled|bool|A Boolean flag that enables or disables the `systemd` collector.

|units|[]string|A list of regular expression (regex) patterns that match systemd units to be included by the `systemd` collector. By default, the list is empty, so the collector exposes no metrics for systemd units.
