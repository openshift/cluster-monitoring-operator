  # A POD IS SLOWLY REPLACED BUT THE UP METRIC CONTINUES TO EXIST FOR THE OLD POD
  # The endpoind should be unregistered from the Prometheus config when the old pod goes down; this is an occurence of the following bug:
  # https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1943860
  # The new pod takes 20 minutes to start:
  # -> We check that the alert fires for a few minutes.
  # -> When the new pod starts the alert is dismissed thanks to the workaround implemented in OCPBUGS-1453 / OSD-13070 / OHSS-14889.
  #    The workaround make sure that the "up" metric is joined with the "kube_pod_info" metric whenever possible.
  #    This undefines the "up" metric when the pod is down.
